**Project Overview**

The YouTube Transcript Summarizer is a web application designed to extract and summarize the transcript of YouTube videos. This tool provides users with a concise summary of video content, making it easier to grasp the key points without watching the entire video. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
