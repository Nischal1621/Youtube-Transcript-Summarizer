**Project Overview**
The YouTube Transcript Summarizer is a web application designed to extract and summarize the transcript of YouTube videos. This tool provides users with a concise summary of video content, making it easier to grasp the key points without watching the entire video. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, it does not connect to any database and retrieves the transcript through a backend API. Once the transcript is summarized, a popup will display the summary to the user.
